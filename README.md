# WebShop sample

This is a playground how a .NET WebApi project might look like. 

The goal is to write clean code that solves issues systematically, while taking into account performance, scalability, resilience, development speed, developer experience, etc.. 

Each step will be documented at my blog (available at [https://engineeringwithfilip.com](https://engineeringwithfilip.com)) and/or a YouTube channel.

The topics that we plan to cover are:
- Modeling models and their relationships
- Outbox pattern
- Transactions, revisited
- Mail sending
- Cron jobs
- Feature flags
- AB testing
- Auditing
- Uploading files
- Downloading files and reports
- Handling messages

## Running the project
 - Download the source code
 - Execute `docker-compose up` to start the required services
 - Run the project
